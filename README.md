Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems.
Importance of software engineering
- Quality and realability by ensuring that softwares meet the required requirements
- innovating - softwares help companies to be innovative and stay competitive and relevant in business.
- collabolation and communication, promotes communication among teams and stakeholders.
- problem solving - provides a systematic approach to solving complex problems, breaking them down into manageable components.

Three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.  NATO Software Engineering Conference - a conference which happened in 1968 by bringing experts together that discussed opportunities and problems in software engineering leading to establishment of software engineering as a principle.
2. Agile Development - The Agile Manifesto (2001) and iterative development methodologies like Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) further transformed software engineering by emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery.
3. Waterfall Model and Structured Programming - introduced by winston royce in 1970, was the first adopted methodology in software engineering. It emphasized a linear, phase-by-phase approach to development.

phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning - Define project scope, goals, and deliverables. identify stakeholders requirements, project timeline, budget and resources
2. Analysis - gather documentation software, define functional and non-functional requirements.
3. design - develop the design of the software and create UX and User interface.
4. implementation - writing code for the software and conduct unit and intergration testing.
5. testing -conduct various types of testing such as functional,performance and security to ensure that the software is performing all the necessary requirments.
6. deploymnent - configure and setup the software for end users
7. mainteinance - monitor to fix bugs and defects to ensure smooth operation

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. 
**Waterfall**
   **Pros**
 - suitable for small projects with less reuirements
 - predictable timeline and budget

   **Cons**
-  inflexible to change requirmenents
-  high risk of project failure due to changing requirments

**Agile**
   **Pros**
  - suitable for complex projects
  - Adaptable to changing requirements and priorities

  **Cons**
-  Can be challenging to manage and track progress
-  Less predictable timeline and budget

**Key Differences**
- waterfall requires fixed requirements whereas Agile requires flexible reqiurements.
- waterfall is linear while agile is itarative.

**Example Scenario of waterfall Model**
building a house or an apartment, this has fixed requirements, timelines and budget, for example you need to start with the ground level, then building and roofing.

**Example Scenario of Agile Model**
developing an e-commerce website such as Ebay, this may change according to change in user requirements, marketing trends and customer needs hence making it iterative.


 roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**Software Developer**
- design, develop and test software applications.
- write codes, write documentations ofsoftwares
**Quality Assuarance Engineer**
-  Identify, report, and track software defects
- Participate in code reviews to ensure testability and quality
**Project Manager**
-  Lead and manage software development projects from initiation to delivery
- Define project scope, goals, and deliverables
- Develop and manage project schedules, budgets, and resources


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
